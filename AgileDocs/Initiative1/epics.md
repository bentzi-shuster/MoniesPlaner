# **Epic: User Authentication and Secure Access**

## ðŸ“Œ **Introduction**

This epic focuses on implementing user authentication and secure access mechanisms for the application to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information and features.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Epic Objective**

**Objective**: To establish a robust user authentication process and ensure secure access to the application.

### **Acceptance Criteria for Epic**:

1. **Given** the need for user authentication and secure access,
   **When** users attempt to access protected pages,
   **Then** the system should prompt them to log in or register.

2. **Given** a registered user attempting to log in,
   **When** valid credentials are provided,
   **Then** the user should be granted access to the application's features.

3. **Given** a registered user attempting to log in,
   **When** invalid credentials are provided,
   **Then** the user should receive an error message and not be granted access.

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Story 1: User Registration and Authentication**

**Objective**: To allow users to register and authenticate themselves securely within the application.

### **User Story**:

*As a new user,
I want to be able to create an account and log in securely,
So that I can access personalized features and information.*

### **Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** a new user attempting to register,
   **When** valid registration details are provided,
   **Then** the user should be able to create an account and receive a confirmation email.

2. **Given** a registered user attempting to log in,
   **When** valid credentials are provided,
   **Then** the user should be authenticated and directed to the application's dashboard.

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Story 2: Password Recovery**

**Objective**: To provide users with a mechanism to recover their account in case of forgotten passwords.

### **User Story**:

*As a user who has forgotten my password,
I want to be able to recover my account and reset my password,
So that I can regain access to my account.*

### **Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** a user requesting password recovery,
   **When** valid account information is provided,
   **Then** the user should receive an email with a password reset link.

2. **Given** a user with a password reset link,
   **When** the link is clicked and a new password is entered,
   **Then** the user's password should be successfully reset.

# **Epic: Setting a PostgreSQL Docker Container Database**

## ðŸ“Œ **Introduction**

This epic focuses on establishing a PostgreSQL database using Docker containers, providing a scalable and manageable database solution for the application.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Epic Objective**

**Objective**: To set up a PostgreSQL database using Docker containers for the application's data storage needs.

### **Acceptance Criteria for Epic**:

1. **Given** the need for a database solution,
   **When** Docker containers are used to create a PostgreSQL instance,
   **Then** the database should be accessible and functional within the container.

2. **Given** the PostgreSQL container,
   **When** configurations and settings are applied,
   **Then** the database should persist data even after container restarts.

3. **Given** the PostgreSQL container,
   **When** security measures are implemented,
   **Then** the database should be secured with appropriate credentials and access controls.

## ðŸŽ¯ **User Story 1: Create PostgreSQL Docker Container**

**Objective**: To set up a Docker container with a PostgreSQL database.

### **User Story**:

*As a DevOps engineer,
I want to create a PostgreSQL container to ensure a consistent and reproducible database environment.*

### **Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** Docker is installed on the host machine,
   **When** a PostgreSQL Docker container is created,
   **Then** it should use a specified PostgreSQL image and the database service should be running.

2. **Given** a running PostgreSQL container,
   **When** the container is stopped and restarted,
   **Then** the data stored in the database should persist.

## User Story 2: Configure PostgreSQL Settings

**Objective**: Customize PostgreSQL settings to suit the application's requirements.

**Story**: As a database administrator, I want to configure PostgreSQL with appropriate settings for optimal performance and security.

### **Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** a running PostgreSQL container,
   **When** configurations related to memory and connections are applied,
   **Then** PostgreSQL should perform efficiently based on the specified settings.

2. **Given** a running PostgreSQL container,
   **When** security settings including authentication and access controls are enforced,
   **Then** the database should be adequately protected against unauthorized access.
